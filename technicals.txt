They bring you the first box with the instructions that you can put and apple in one hole and an orange will come out of the other. What tests will you perform on the box to assure its quality and functionality before it goes into production and is distributed to millions of people? [You cannot open the box]

- join table
  -- In a simple real estate app, with DB tables for Agent [id, name] & Property [id, address, agent_id] write a SQL query that will return the address of every property, along with that property's agent's name, sorted by agent name
    + SELECT address, a.name
      FROM property p
      INNER JOIN agent a
      ON a.id = p.agent_id
      ORDER BY a.name

- ajax/custom rails route for some method
  -- class UsersController < ApplicationController
       def jump
         puts "jumped #{params[:jumps]}"
       end
     end

     write a route that I can POST to liek so: localhost:3000/jump/7
     post '/jump/:jumps', to: 'users#jump', as: 'jump'

     Ajax to the route:
     $.ajax({
      url: '/jumps/7'
      type: 'POST'
     })

- diff between class/module
  -- a class is a blueprint for an object that can be instantiated, a module cannot (more of a library)

- reverse array without reverse
  -- rev([1, 2, 3, 'hello'])
    + def rev(arr)
        new_arr = []
        arr.each do |x|
          new_arr.unshift(x)
        end
      end
    + def rev(arr)
        new_arr = []
        while arr.length > 0
          new_arr << arr.pop
        end
      end

- fizzbuzz in js in ES6
  -- takes in some number:
      n / 3 ? -> 'Fizz'
      n / 5 ? -> 'Buzz'
      n / 3 & n / 5 ? -> 'Fizzbuzz'
      ! -> n

- explain componentWillMount(before render) vs componentDidMount(after render)
- when is render called (when component mounts, forceupdate is called, recieves new props, state change)
